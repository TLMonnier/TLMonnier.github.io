- [The Informality Trade-Off: Wages and Rural-Urban Migration in South Africa](https://tlmonnier.github.io/files/Monnier_JMP.pdf) \[JOB MARKET PAPER\]

	<u>Abstract</u>: In rapidly urbanizing low- and middle-income countries, many rural migrants work in the informal sector, without benefits and for low wages. Would these migrants be better off if the informal sector did not exist? To answer this question, I develop a novel general-equilibrium model of rural-urban migration based on frictional job search and matching, which I estimate using South African micro data on workers. I find that the urban informal sector serves as a stepping-stone to urban formal jobs. Moreover, I find that it is a valuable outside option for urban formal workers and that its decline can increase the local labour market power of formal firms, which then offer lower wages. This phenomenon makes cities less attractive, even in the absence of direct job destruction, and is exacerbated by the response of rural firms that offer higher wages and retain potential migrants: after a tripling of monitoring costs, 2.2% of the total population decides not to move, equivalent to 2.7 years of urban growth at current rates. The corresponding rural-urban welfare gap falls from 29.2% to 25.5%. Overall, the decline in urban informality improves the allocation of labour, both across sectors in urban areas and towards more productive firms in rural areas. However, the aggregate impact is muted because there are now more workers in less productive areas.

	<u>Abstract</u>: Building on a two-dimensional discrete version of the standard urban economics land-use model, this paper presents a tractable urban land-use simulation model that is adapted to developing country cities, where formal and informal housing submarkets coexist. The dynamic closed-city framework simulates developers’ construction decisions and heterogeneous households’ housing and location choices at a distance from various employment subcenters, while accounting at the same time for land-use regulations, natural constraints, exogenous amenities, and dynamic scenarios of urban population growth and of State-driven subsidized housing. Designed and calibrated for Cape Town, South Africa, the model is used to assess the impact of an urban growth boundary, showing that restricting the possibility of urban expansion makes formal housing more expensive and results in a growing informal housing sector. Another simulation assesses the impacts of changes in the scale of subsidized housing schemes, showing a shift from residences in informal settlement to the backyards of the newly constructed houses.

- Can the Urban Poor Avoid Flood Risks? The Case of Cape Town, South Africa (joint with [Paolo Avner](https://blogs.worldbank.org/team/paolo-avner), [Charlotte Liotta](https://www.centre-cired.fr/charlotte-liotta/), [Basile Pfeiffer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basile-pfeiffer-3a630986?originalSubdomain=fr), [Claus Rabe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claus-rabe-ba099119/?originalSubdomain=za), [Harris Selod](https://sites.google.com/site/hselod/), and [Vincent Viguié](https://www.vincentviguie.com/))

	<u>Abstract</u>: In developing country cities, poor households often reside in unattractive locations, including flood-prone areas. This can be due to poor information about flood risks or acceptance of these risks in the face of lower housing prices. Poor households are also more vulnerable to floods than richer ones given the low-quality housing they occupy. Does information on flood risks help households make better location and housing choices? To what extent will these choices be revised with increased exposure from climate change? To answer these questions, we develop a polycentric urban economics model with heterogeneous income groups, formal and informal housing, and three types of flood risks (fluvial, pluvial, and coastal). The model is calibrated to the city of Cape Town and simulations are run to assess the impact of flood risks on land values and income segregation. Although total damages from floods are greater for rich households, they represent a larger relative share of poor households’ incomes. Better information and climate change encourage the relocation of households outside flood-prone zones, but the poor have more inertia due to more stringent financial constraints.

- Optimal Spatial Policies with Robust Skill Spillovers (joint with [David Gomtsyan](https://dgomtsyan.weebly.com/))

	<u>Abstract</u>: Existing evidence points to substantial positive and negative externalities on local amenities and productivities depending on the skill mix of the resident population in a given local labour market. This leads to inefficient spatial sorting of workers at the national scale. However, the policy recommendations associated with the optimal allocation of workers are very sensitive to the estimation of the underlying spillover elasticities. In this paper, we propose a meta-analysis of local population composition shocks studied in the literature to estimate a statistically robust range for those values, and discuss how this affects current evaluations. Preliminary results suggest that not accounting for asymmetric mobility responses of high- vs. low-skilled workers in the face of positive vs. negative shocks may be an important source of bias in existing models.
