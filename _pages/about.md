I am an Assistant Professor at the [Hitotsubashi](https://www.hit-u.ac.jp/eng/) [Institute for Advanced Study](https://hias.hit-u.ac.jp/en/), affilitated with the [Center for Urban and Real Estate Studies](https://cures.hias.hit-u.ac.jp/en/). 

In my research, I apply structural models (mostly from **urban economics**) to current topics in **development economics**. I obtained my PhD in Economics from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) - [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), where I was affiliated with [CREST](https://crest.science/). There, I wrote my dissertation on the ambiguous role of *informal labour and housing* in urbanizing countries, taking South Africa as a case study. I am interested more widely in structural transformation, climate change vulnerability, and public policies. As part of my PhD, I also worked as a consultant for the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home).
