I am a PhD candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science/), [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) under the supervision of [Pr. Benoit Schmutz](https://sites.google.com/site/benoitschmutz/) and [Pr. Anthony Strittmatter](https://www.anthonystrittmatter.com/) since September 2021.

My research lies at the intersection of urban, labor, and environmental economics. More specifically, I focus on the evaluation of place-based policies and their link with matching externalities in local labor markets, as well as residential segregation and disaster risk management.
