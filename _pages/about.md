I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [CREST](https://crest.science/), [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en). In September 2025, I will be joining [Hitotsubashi University](https://www.hit-u.ac.jp/eng/) ([Institute for Advanced Study](https://hias.hit-u.ac.jp/en/)) as an Assistant Professor.

In my research, I apply structural approaches (mostly from **urban economics**) to questions in **development economics**. I wrote my PhD dissertation on the role of informal labour and housing in South Africa, and I am working more widely on migration, urbanization, climate change, factor misallocation, structural transformation, and place-based policies. As part of my PhD, I also worked as a consultant for the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home).

***What's new***:
- Our paper (joint with Paolo Avner, Basile Pfeiffer, Clause Rabe, Harris Selod, and Vincent Vigui√©) on [informal housing in Cape Town](https://tlmonnier.github.io/files/Pfeiffer_CoCT.pdf) is currently under revision at the *Journal of Urban Economics*.
- I will also be presenting this and other work at the [9th Urbanization and Developement Conference](https://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2025/06/11/9th-urbanization-and-development-conference) that will be held in Cape Town, South Africa (June 11-12, 2025).
