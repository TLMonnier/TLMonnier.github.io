I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [CREST](https://crest.science/), [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), working under the supervision of Prof. Benoit Schmutz-Bloch.

My research lies at the intersection of development, urban, and labour economics. More specifically, I focus on how informal employment and informal housing relate to key challenges faced by cities in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., migration, unemployment, climate change). I am also interested in spatial sorting and residential segregation.

During my PhD, I visited the Dept. of Economics at University College London. You can find my full CV [here](https://tlmonnier.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
