	<u>Abstract</u>: In developing country cities, poor households often reside in unattractive locations, including flood-prone areas. This can be due to poor information about flood risks or acceptance of these risks in the face of lower housing prices. Poor households are also more vulnerable to floods than richer ones given the low-quality housing they occupy. Does information on flood risks help households make better location and housing choices? To what extent will these choices be revised with increased exposure from climate change? To answer these questions, we develop a polycentric urban economics model with heterogeneous income groups, formal and informal housing, and three types of flood risks (fluvial, pluvial, and coastal). The model is calibrated to the city of Cape Town and simulations are run to assess the impact of flood risks on land values and income segregation. Although total damages from floods are greater for rich households, they represent a larger relative share of poor households’ incomes. Better information and climate change encourage the relocation of households outside flood-prone zones, but the poor have more inertia due to more stringent financial constraints.

- Optimal Spatial Policies with Robust Skill Spillovers (joint with [David Gomtsyan](https://dgomtsyan.weebly.com/))

	<u>Abstract</u>: Existing evidence points to substantial positive and negative externalities on local amenities and productivities depending on the skill mix of the resident population in a given local labour market. This leads to inefficient spatial sorting of workers at the national scale. However, the policy recommendations associated with the optimal allocation of workers are very sensitive to the estimation of the underlying spillover elasticities. In this paper, we propose a meta-analysis of local population composition shocks studied in the literature to estimate a statistically robust range for those values, and discuss how this affects current evaluations. Preliminary results suggest that not accounting for asymmetric mobility responses of high- vs. low-skilled workers in the face of positive vs. negative shocks may be an important source of bias in existing models.
