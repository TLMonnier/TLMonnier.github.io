I am a PhD candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science/), [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) working under the supervision of [Pr. Benoit Schmutz](https://sites.google.com/site/benoitschmutz/) since September 2021.

My research lies at the intersection of urban, labour, and development economics. More specifically, I focus on how informal housing and informal employment relate to key challenges faced by cities in the developing world (e.g. disaster risk management, climate change, migration). I am also interested in spatial sorting and residential segregation.
